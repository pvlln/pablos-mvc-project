## Description

I created Sequel application for a store's database, that includes products, tags and categories. 

## Installation
To install this app, you will need to install npm and mysql and be able to access mysql databases. After doing this, you will need to run the commands "npm run seed" in your computer terminal. Then, you can use the command "npm start" in your command line to start the application. Finally, you can test the routes using insomnia.

Here is a screen recording of my application in action:
